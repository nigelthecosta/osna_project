**1)osna_mid.ipynb**
- This contains all the EDA and all the code for the deliverables upto the mid project report. 
- Ensure that the elstats_search_23575a519141a70c_copy.csv (available in repo) file is also uploaded into the same directory as the ipynb file.
- Further instructers will be present in the comments for each code block.
- **NOTE** : The api key in the beginning must be replaced by your own API key which can be obtained by requesting an ACS API key here:
https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
- Each cell can be run using the run button.

**2)OSNA_Code_Final.ipynb**

- This contains all the models and predictions for the deliverables after the mid project report.
- Ensure that the

 2)df_new.csv
 3)president.csv,  (all available in repo) files are also uploaded into the same directory as the ipynb file.
